# code-refactor

In this project, the goal was to further improve accessibility.  The way to do that is to refactor existing code given by client while practicing the Scout Rule to achieve a sustainable, efficient and an easier-to-follow code. Eventually, the website becomes more accessible to those with disabilities, better positioned in search engines, and easier to follow by other web developers. The list below describes fixes done to this project.

	▪	“Search Engine Optimization” link fixed in the header.

	▪	Broke down long lines in the p tags into multiple lines to achieve clean and organized HTML code.

	▪	Replaced non-semantic elements with semantic ones and adjusted CSS to follow.

	▪	Combined classes that share the same styling into one class.

	▪	Added necessary comments in HTML and CSS files
